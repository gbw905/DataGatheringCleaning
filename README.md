## Assignment for "Getting and Cleaning Data", Februrary 2015:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
      
## Input as described in the submission instructions: 
The code should have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory.
    
*To Do to get the input data:* 
- *Download the input data zip file from the following link.* 
- *Unzip the zip file to your 'working directory'*
- *Include the folder structure stored in the zip file when you unzip the file*
